# Soft Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository provides code and resources associated with our paper titled _Soft CNNs_. We study an interpolated architecture which intuitively lies between an MLP and a classical CNN on the spectrum of inductive bias. In particular, we depart from the trraditional sparsity assumption inherent in CNNs while preserving their weight sharing.
